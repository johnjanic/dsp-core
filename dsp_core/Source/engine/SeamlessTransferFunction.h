/**
 * SeamlessTransferFunction - Reusable click-free transfer function with async LUT rendering
 *
 * GOAL: Eliminate clicks/pops during ALL transfer function edits while maintaining
 *       <50ms latency for interactive operations.
 *
 * ARCHITECTURE: Three-thread design with 25Hz polling
 *   - Message thread: UI/controller mutates editing model, 25Hz poller detects changes
 *   - Worker thread: Renders LUTs asynchronously from self-contained snapshots
 *   - Audio thread: Triple-buffered LUT with 10ms linear crossfade (sample-rate-adaptive)
 *
 * KEY DESIGN DECISIONS:
 *   - Self-contained RenderJobs with NO ContentStore dependency (preserves dsp-core module purity)
 *   - Triple buffering prevents data race during crossfade
 *   - Job coalescing (only renders latest version)
 *   - Hardcoded constants (16384 table size, -1.0 to 1.0 range) for performance
 *   - Visualizer shows latest rendered LUT (target curve audio is crossfading toward)
 *
 * PERFORMANCE:
 *   - Latency: <50ms for interactive operations (harmonic sliders, paint strokes)
 *   - CPU overhead: <0.5% (25Hz polling + worker thread)
 *   - Memory overhead: ~1.4MB (393KB triple-buffered LUTs + ~1MB job queue)
 *
 * REUSABILITY:
 *   - Drop-in replacement for LayeredTransferFunction
 *   - Can be reused across multiple Aspen Instruments plugins
 *   - No plugin-specific dependencies

    /**
     * INITIALIZATION SEQUENCE (REQUIRED ORDER):
     *
     * 1. Construct SeamlessTransferFunction
     *    - editingModel initialized to identity
     *    - AudioEngine initialized to identity LUTs
     *    - Worker/poller NOT started yet
     *
     * 2. Create controller: new TransferFunctionController(stf.getEditingModel())
     *    - Controller can now mutate editing model
     *    - Still no async updates happening
     *
     * 3. Call startSeamlessUpdates() (message thread)
     *    - Starts worker thread and 25Hz poller
     *    - Triggers initial LUT render for visualizer
     *    - From this point, edits trigger async LUT renders
     *    - MUST be called AFTER controller creation
     *
     * 4. Call prepareToPlay(sampleRate, samplesPerBlock) (audio thread)
     *    - Sets up crossfade duration based on sample rate
     *    - Can be called before or after startSeamlessUpdates()
     *
     * 5. Normal operation: process audio, make edits
     *
     * 6. Call releaseResources() before destruction
     *    - Stops worker thread cleanly
     *
     * EXAMPLE (from PluginProcessor):
     *
     *   // Constructor (message thread):
     *   transferFunction = std::make_unique<SeamlessTransferFunction>();
     *   controller = std::make_unique<TransferFunctionController>(
     *       transferFunction->getEditingModel()
     *   );
     *   transferFunction->startSeamlessUpdates();  // NOW safe to start
     *
     *   // prepareToPlay (audio thread):
     *   transferFunction->prepareToPlay(sampleRate, samplesPerBlock);
     *
     *   // releaseResources (audio thread):
     *   transferFunction->releaseResources();
