/**
 * @brief Thread-safe stereo ring buffer that guarantees X/Y sample correspondence.
 *
 * This buffer solves the synchronization problem where separate X and Y history
 * buffers can become desynchronized when read from the UI thread while the audio
 * thread is writing. Uses a seqlock pattern to detect when reads overlap with writes.
 *
 * Thread Safety:
 * - pushSample/pushSamples: Called from audio thread only (not thread-safe for multiple writers)
 * - getHistory: Can be called from any thread while audio thread is writing
 * - clear: Should only be called when audio is stopped
 *
 * Synchronization Strategy (Seqlock):
 * - Writer increments sequence to odd before writing, even after writing
 * - Reader checks sequence before and after reading
 * - If sequence changed or was odd, reader retries with cached fallback
 * - This guarantees readers always see a consistent snapshot
