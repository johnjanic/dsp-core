/**
 * Configuration for spline curve fitting algorithm.
 *
 * The fitting algorithm uses adaptive tolerance to prevent "anchor creeping" - the problem
 * where refitting curves produces exponentially more anchors on each cycle.
 *
 * Key behavioral characteristics:
 * - Adaptive tolerance increases with anchor density to prevent over-fitting
 * - Backtranslation stable: refit curves converge to minimal anchor count
 * - Anchor counts scale with geometric complexity (matches Chebyshev extrema)
 * - Typical results: H1=2, H2=2, H3=3, H5=5, H10=10 anchors
 *
 * See docs/architecture/spline-curve-fitting.md for detailed algorithm documentation.
